`love-DPBR` is a **D**eferred **P**hysically **B**ased **R**endering LÖVE library.

At the frontier between 2D and 3D, it aims to be a simple and versatile tool to do PBR rendering. It doesn't aim to be a 3D rendering engine.

.Use case examples
- 3D baked scene: Point&Click, title screen, etc.
- 2D side/top views: lighting, etc.
- 2D isometric/pseudo-isometric: proper overlapping of tiles, lighting, etc.
- 3D meshes / SDF ray-marching: use the library as the pipeline for the final rendering
- ...

See link:examples[] (copy the library, install https://github.com/ImagicTheCat/MGL[MGL] and launch the directory with LÖVE).

== API

=== Module

[source,lua]
----
-- Create a scene.
--
-- A scene defines a 2D-3D space (view space), parameters and data to properly
-- render each material/object. Functions requiring 3D coordinates (like a
-- point light) are in view space (defined by the projection). The default
-- projection is 2D/orthographic, with a depth of 10 and "log" normalization.
-- All passes must be called, even if not used, in that order:
--   Material -> Light -> Background -> Blend => Render
--
-- All colors must be linear unless an option for other color spaces exists.
-- If the API is too limited, it is better to write custom shaders and directly
-- call the LÖVE API and work around the library to fill the buffers (ex:
-- ray-marching SDF, different kind of textures, etc.).
--
-- w,h: render dimensions
-- settings: (optional) map of settings
--- half_float: flag, use "16f" instead of "32f" for floating-point buffers
-- return Scene
M.newScene(w, h, settings)

-- Bind canvases and shader.
-- The material pass is the process of writing the albedo/shape (RGBA), normal,

--
-- The albedo texture is to be used with LÖVE draw calls, it defines the albedo
-- and shape (alpha, 0 discard pixels) of the object (affected by LÖVE color).

-- The metalness sets the material as dielectric/insulator or
-- metallic/conductor (0: dielectric, 1: metallic).
-- The roughness determines the surface roughness (0-1).
-- The ambient factor determines the final intensity of ambient/indirect
-- lighting (also known as ambient occlusion, 0: full occlusion, 1: no
-- occlusion).

Scene:drawEmissionLight(intensity)

-- Bind raw light.
-- Used to add raw light on the light buffer with draw calls.

-- Bind render canvas.
-- This pass is used to fill the render background with HDR colors (floats)
-- before the final rendering. No operation is performed by default (no clear).
Scene:bindBackgroundPass()

-- Bind canvases and shader.
-- The blend pass is similar to the material pass. It is the process of
-- blending the color/shape (RGBA) of objects to the render buffer, using
-- depth/emission data. It can be used to create various effects like lighting,
-- darkening, transparency, etc.
--
-- The color texture is to be used with LÖVE draw calls, it defines the
-- color/light and shape/opacity (alpha, 0 discard pixels) of the object
-- (affected by LÖVE color and multiplied by emission).
-- Material settings and Scene:bindMaterialDE are used.
Scene:bindBlendPass()

-- Final rendering (output normalized colors).
-- target: (optional) target canvas (on screen otherwise)

== Guidance

=== Ambient / environment lighting

For ambient / indirect lighting, the BRDF lookup texture must be loaded. One can be generated using link:tools/bake.lua[] or the precomputed link:examples/BRDF_LUT.exr[] can be re-used (16-bit float, 512x512, 1024 samples).

For environment / IBL (image-based lighting), the partial diffuse and specular irradiance must be computed into two cubemaps.

.https://github.com/dariomanesku/cmftStudio[cmftStudio] can be used to compute the cubemaps:
- Make sure to keep the HDRI in linear color space for all processing.
- The _Irradiance_ cubemap is the diffuse cubemap.
- The _Radiance_ cubemap is the specular cubemap. Unfortunately, *cmft* doesn't seem to support the Cook-Torrance BRDF used in this library; the _blinnBRDF_ lighting model is probably the closest available.
- Very high intensity in the input HDRI can give invalid outputs, clipping may be needed.

NOTE: The examples environment cubemaps are computed from https://hdrihaven.com/hdri/?c=nature&h=greenwich_park_02[Greenwich Park 02] from HDRIHaven.

== References

=== PBR

The implemented PBR is mostly based on the PBR tutorials from https://learnopengl.com/[learnopengl] and this https://blog.selfshadow.com/publications/s2013-shading-course/karis/s2013_pbs_epic_notes_v2.pdf[paper] from Epic Games.

The filmic tone mapping operator comes from John Hable's http://filmicworlds.com/blog/filmic-tonemapping-operators/[post].

=== Bloom

The implemented bloom is based on the technique explained https://catlikecoding.com/unity/tutorials/advanced-rendering/bloom/[here] and take inspirations from https://github.com/keijiro/KinoBloom[KinoBloom] and https://www.blender.org/[Blender EEVEE] implementations.

.Rough explanation
- Bright areas are extracted from the render.
- The result is downsampled successively N times with a 2x2 blur filter, effectively applying a 4x4 blur filter (texture bilinear filtering).
- The result is then upsampled successively N times the same way and accumulated to each previous downsampled buffer until finally added to the render.

=== FXAA

The implementation is based on this https://catlikecoding.com/unity/tutorials/advanced-rendering/fxaa/[tutorial] about FXAA 3.11.
